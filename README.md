# Personal-Planner

The personal planner is a web application built using Django. It provides the user with an interactive personal assistant experience, and displays the user inputs in a clear and minimal layout on the dashboard page. The web application is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed at https://djangoplannerapp.herokuapp.com/.

The user creates an item on the home page, inputting a category, item name, and due date.

All of the items are displayed on the dashboard page, and are organized in a way such that the user can easily visualize his or her entire schedule. The items are divided by category, and are sorted by due date.

Clicking on the item title leads to a page with a delete button, where the user can remove the item from the dashboard.
